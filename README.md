# 🐍 Snake Game using Python 

A classic Snake Game built with Python and Pygame. Control the snake to eat the red food, grow longer, and avoid hitting the walls or itself. This simple project is perfect for learning basic game development concepts using the `pygame` library.

## 🧱 How It Works

- The snake starts at a fixed location and moves continuously.
- Use arrow keys to change its direction:
  - ⬅️ Left
  - ➡️ Right
  - ⬆️ Up
  - ⬇️ Down
- When the snake eats food, it grows, and a new piece of food appears.
- If the snake hits the wall or itself, the game ends and shows a "Game Over" message.
